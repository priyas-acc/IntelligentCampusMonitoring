# Intelligent Campus Monitoring and Tracking System üöÄ

## Project Overview
Our mini project develops an AI-driven facial recognition system to automate real-time student monitoring and enhance campus security. Traditional attendance methods face issues like manual errors and lack of real-time tracking. This system automates student identification at campus entry and exit points, improving accuracy and efficiency.

## Technology & Methodology üß†
- **Face Detection:** Utilizes Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network (MTCNN) for robust detection under diverse conditions.
- **Face Recognition:** Employs the ArcFace deep learning model to generate face embeddings and identify students with high accuracy.
- **Data Processing:** Matches captured face data against a secure student database containing register numbers and photographs.
- **Logging:** Records entry and exit timestamps in MySQL while avoiding duplicate logs within short intervals.

## Web Dashboard & Security üñ•Ô∏èüîí
- Developed a responsive web dashboard using PHP and Bootstrap.
- Supports role-based access control for Admin, Head of Department (HOD), and Faculty.
- Includes management modules for students, batches, faculty, and departments.
- Provides real-time monitoring and alert notifications for uninformed student movements.

## Alerts & Impact üîî
The alert system flags students entering or exiting without faculty notification, ensuring timely administrative actions. This reduces manual workload, enhances campus security, and offers scalable monitoring solutions for educational institutions.
